      <h3>Detect Phishing Attacks on Telegram </h3>
      <p>PhishFort has developed technologies to help defend against phishing campaigns launched through Telegram, the popular
        messaging application.</p>
      <h3>TELEGRAM BOT</h3>
      <p>Our Telegram bot administers links sent to your Telegram group. Links are automatically analyzed using our anti-phishing
        engine, removing the reliance on users reporting phishing infrastructure.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>HONEYPOT ACCOUNTS</h3>
      <p>We deploy honeypot accounts to your Telegram groups that act as normal users. Messages that they receive are automatically
        analyzed to detect any phishing content. Alerts are generated instantly, in order to detect attacks on your users
        as soon as possible.</p>

      <h3>Early Detection of Phishing Infrastructure </h3>
      <p>Early detection of phishing campaigns gives you more time to respond to the threat. The Phishing Killchain provides
        a way to measure how early the detection is happening. Our services aim to detect phishing infrastructure targeting
        our clients as early as possible, in an attempt to take it down before users can be targeted.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>DOMAIN REGISTRATION MONITORING</h3>
      <p>We monitor hundreds of top-level domains (TLDs, e.g. .com, .net, etc.) for newly registered domains. Alerts are
        generated if suspicious domains are identified. Examples of suspicious domains include domains that appear to be
        using typosquatting or homograph attacks to target your users.</p>
      <br>
      <h3>BLOCKPHISH</h3>
      <p>PhishFort offers a managed service for the open-source software BlockPhish. It uses certificate streams to detect
        when SSL certificates are generated for domains that may be attempting to spoof your domain.</p>
